CASE-10001 | VERIFIED | screen-visuals:black-screen fan-status:fan-spinning power-lights:light-on system-state:on-no-boot | Replace HDD with SSD and reinstall operating system. Computer powers on but no display output. Likely HDD failure preventing OS boot. Solution: Backup data via USB, replace with 256GB SSD, fresh Windows/Linux install. | 15
CASE-10002 | VERIFIED | screen-visuals:lines-artifacts fan-status:fan-spinning power-lights:light-on cpu-temp:temp-above-85 | Thermal paste replacement on CPU. Graphics corruption indicates thermal throttling. Solution: Remove heatsink, clean old thermal paste with isopropyl alcohol, apply Arctic Silver thermal paste, reinstall heatsink with proper pressure. System boots normally after cooling. | 12
CASE-10003 | VERIFIED | sound-output:sound-none sound-quality:sound-none volume-bar:bar-moving card-status:card-detected | Update or reinstall audio driver. Volume mixer shows activity but no sound. Solution: Device Manager > Sound, Video and Game Controllers > Right-click audio device > Update driver. If failed, uninstall and reboot to auto-reinstall. | 18
CASE-10004 | VERIFIED | fan-status:fan-silent power-lights:light-off system-state:power-off beep-code:beep-none | Power supply failure. Computer completely dead with no lights or fan spin. Solution: Test PSU with multimeter (should show 12V, 5V rails). If failed, replace with equivalent wattage PSU from trusted brand (Corsair, Seasonic). | 20
CASE-10005 | VERIFIED | system-state:on-no-boot beep-code:beep-very-short error-message:err-disk-boot-failure | Check HDD connections. One beep + boot failure = RAM/GPU issue or loose HDD cable. Solution: Power off, open case, reseat SATA cable on HDD, reseat RAM modules (push down until click), power on. If persists, test HDD in external caddy. | 14
CASE-10006 | VERIFIED | cpu-temp:temp-rising-rapidly fan-status:fan-silent system-state:random-shutdowns | Fan bearing failure or thermal paste degradation. Computer shuts down unexpectedly during gaming/heavy load. Solution: Check BIOS fan speed (should ramp up at 60C+). If silent, fan is dead > Replace heatsink fan assembly. Apply new thermal paste. | 16
CASE-10007 | VERIFIED | error-message:err-smart-warning screen-visuals:black-screen | Imminent HDD failure (SMART error detected). Solution: Immediately backup all data to external drive using Linux live USB. Do not continue using drive for extended periods. Replace with new SSD within 24 hours to prevent total data loss. | 22
CASE-10008 | VERIFIED | beep-code:beep-repeated-long fan-status:fan-spinning light-on | RAM not detected or incompatible. Continuous long beeps indicate RAM slot issue. Solution: Power off, remove all RAM sticks, clean gold contacts with pencil eraser, reseat firmly in slot until both clips click. If one stick fails, try each slot individually to isolate bad stick. | 19
CASE-10009 | VERIFIED | sound-output:sound-distorted sound-quality:sound-distorted volume-bar:bar-moving | Faulty speaker or audio amplifier. Scratchy/distorted sound indicates hardware damage, not driver issue. Solution: If laptop, replace speaker module (cost $30-80). If desktop, test with external speakers. If external works, internal speaker/audio jack is damaged. | 11
CASE-10010 | VERIFIED | screen-visuals:distorted-image cpu-temp:temp-normal volume-bar:bar-moving system-age:age-old | Faulty GPU memory or HDMI cable issue. Corrupted display with normal temperature = GPU not CPU. Solution: Reseat GPU (if desktop), try different monitor/HDMI cable. If on integrated graphics, update chipset driver. Laptop GPU failure requires professional repair. | 13
CASE-10011 | VERIFIED | error-message:err-ide-not-ready beep-code:beep-short system-state:on-no-boot boot-warn:warn-none | IDE/SATA controller issue or legacy BIOS setting. Solution: Enter BIOS (Del/F2 at startup), verify SATA mode is set to AHCI (not IDE). If already AHCI, try Legacy mode. Update chipset drivers from motherboard manufacturer website. | 9
CASE-10012 | VERIFIED | fan-status:fan-spinning power-lights:light-on cpu-temp:temp-normal sound-output:sound-normal screen-visuals:clear-display | No issue detected. All system diagnostics normal. Computer is functioning properly. Solution: Monitor system over next few days. If symptoms reappear, schedule preventive maintenance (dust cleaning, thermal paste refresh). | 25
CASE-10013 | VERIFIED | system-state:random-shutdowns cpu-temp:temp-above-85 fan-status:fan-spinning boot-warn:warn-cpu-overheat | CPU thermal throttling causing shutdowns. Temperature exceeds safe limit during gaming/rendering. Solution: (1) Clear dust from heatsink fins with compressed air. (2) Reapply thermal paste. (3) Ensure CPU fan PWM connector properly plugged in. (4) Monitor temps with HWinfo; should stay below 80C under load. | 17
CASE-10014 | VERIFIED | beep-code:beep-none power-lights:light-on fan-status:fan-spinning screen-visuals:black-screen error-message:err-none | Video card failure (no POST, no beep, no display). Solution: Reseat discrete GPU, remove power connectors and reseat. If integrated GPU available, remove GPU and test with integrated graphics. If PC boots without GPU, then GPU is dead and needs replacement. | 10
CASE-10015 | VERIFIED | system-age:age-old device-age:age-old cpu-temp:temp-above-85 fan-status:fan-silent power-lights:light-on | Heatsink thermal paste completely degraded (old system >3 years without maintenance). Computer is old and thermal compound has hardened. Solution: Disassemble CPU cooler, scrape off all old paste (use plastic scraper), clean with 91% isopropyl alcohol, apply Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut thermal paste, reinstall. Should reduce temps by 15-25C. | 21
CASE-10016 | VERIFIED | volume-bar:bar-irregular volume-behavior:bar-irregular sound-output:sound-none | Audio driver crash or chipset audio subsystem failure. Volume bar fluctuates but no sound plays. Solution: (1) Open Services (services.msc), find Windows Audio, restart service. (2) Check Device Manager for yellow exclamation mark. (3) If present, download latest audio driver from laptop/motherboard manufacturer. (4) If driver install fails, suspect chipset failure (requires pro repair). | 8
CASE-10017 | VERIFIED | system-state:boots-normal sound-output:sound-normal screen-visuals:clear-display cpu-temp:temp-normal | System normal after repair. All diagnostics confirm stable operation post-intervention. Solution: Continue monitoring for 1-2 weeks. Run diagnostics monthly. Keep system clean (dust can reduce thermal performance). Update BIOS/drivers quarterly. | 23
CASE-10018 | VERIFIED | card-status:card-not-detected sound-output:sound-none beep-code:beep-none system-state:boots-normal | Sound card driver uninstalled or chipset audio disabled in BIOS. Solution: Check Device Manager > Sound Devices. If missing, go to BIOS > Onboard Devices > Verify Audio is Enabled. Reboot and install chipset audio driver from motherboard OEM website. If still missing, audio codec chip may be dead (rare). | 7
CASE-10019 | VERIFIED | beep-code:beep-long power-lights:light-on fan-status:fan-spinning screen-visuals:black-screen | Continuous long beep = RAM detection failure (most common POST failure). Solution: (1) Power off, hold power button 30 seconds to discharge. (2) Open case, remove RAM. (3) Clean RAM gold edges with pencil eraser. (4) Reseat into slot firmly (should click on both ends). (5) Boot. If beeps continue, swap RAM slots to identify bad stick. | 24
CASE-10020 | VERIFIED | temp-pattern:temp-above-85 boot-warning:warn-cpu-overheat fan-status:fan-silent system-state:on-no-boot | CPU cooler disconnected or failed. High temps detected at boot but fan not spinning = safety shutdown. Solution: (1) Enter BIOS during boot, check CPU fan status (PWM RPM should show >2000). (2) If 0 RPM, check internal fan header connection on motherboard. (3) Reseat fan power connector. (4) If still not spinning, CPU fan motor is dead > replace heatsink+fan assembly. | 19
